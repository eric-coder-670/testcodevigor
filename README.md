# **PART 2: WRITTEN QUESTIONS**

### QUESTIONS 2.1 explanations:
 I structured my code in this way in order to organize my files according to a logic which is defined and clear in order to allow fairly easy maintenance of the API

 ### in a production environment what I can do differently is:

  1. Automated Testing: Use automated testing to ensure that all new changes work as expected before deployment.

  2. Code maintenance: Ensure that the code is clean, well-documented and easy to maintain.

  3. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Establish a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process and minimize human errors.

  ### Questions 2.2: Code review

  1. it is essential to ensure the validation of all data to ensure that they are in the expected format

  2. manage errors with try/catch because when adding the user there could be malfunctions which would be incomprehensible without error management

3. include more information in error messages to better understand the cause of the malfunction.

4. Use an asynchronous function to wait to wait for the end of each before returning a response.

# **PART 3 Time management task:**

### 3.1 **prioritization and planning:**
 I would proceed according to the priority and importance of each task:
 1. bug fixes: because it directly affects users

 2. in order to satisfy customers, I would look into the development of a new functionality

3. I would subsequently Document the API in order to facilitate its maintainability as well as the work of other members of the team

4. finally I would optimize the database queries
